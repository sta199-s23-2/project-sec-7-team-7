Furthermore, what variables are the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nHeart disease affects hundreds of thousands of people across the world. It can come in many different shapes and forms, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart valve disorders. I hypothesize that the older an individual is, the higher cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure and individual has, the more likely they are to develop a heart disease of large magnitude. I also believe that the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and the number of major vessels are the best predictors of whether or not an individual will develop heart disease.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

This study relied on self-reported data from patients. Overall there was a minor decrease in the prevalence of CHD in the United States among all demographics. Between 2011 and 2018, the rate dropped from 6.2% to 6.0%. There were plenty of geographic and demographic differences and trends that are worth noting. First, there were some declines in adults over 65, college graduates, and residents of Utah. However, the prevalence of CHD rose in areas like Oregon and in adults 18-44.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe data we have focuses more on the health aspects of heart disease, while the study looks at broad trends in demographics and geography.

The hypothesis for question 2 is that billionaires with higher net worth are more likely to be in technology related fields. This relationship changes as age changes because older billionaires are more likely to be in finance since tech was not as big longer ago. The relationship also changes if money was inherited because inherited money more often comes from finance or oil.
