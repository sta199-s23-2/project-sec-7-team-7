We filtered out data of cholesterol = 0 and blood pressure = 0 for regressions involving those variables because it is not possible for a living individual and is likely to do data not being collected or a null value, as opposed to the actual value. We chose these variables and interactions because we wanted a large breadth of variables potentially correlating with heart disease. We then wanted to see how certain interactions we predicted to be important, such as bp and sex, cholesterol and age, blood sugar and age, and cholesterol and sex, predicted heart disease.\nHypothesis Test 1:\nNull hypothesis: The true proportion of males (m) with heart disease is the same as the true proportion of females (f) with heart disease.\nAlternate hypothesis: The true proportion of males with heart disease is not the same as the true proportion of females with heart disease.\n\\(H_0: \\pi_m - \\pi_f = 0\\) \\(H_a: \\pi_m - \\pi_f \\neq 0\\)\n\nheart_disease_fct |>\n  group_by(sex, num) |>\n  summarize(p = n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'.

    "text": "This research project investigated how heart disease presence and magnitude vary based on age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure as well as which of these variables is the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease. For analysis of the best predictors of heart disease, this project used data collected at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology and Cleveland Clinic Foundation was used. This dataset consisted of 920 observations that each represent a case of heart disease with data for 16 variables, however, this analysis was centered around the variables age, sex, num, trestbps, chol and fbs. Through exploratory data analysis, it was concluded that heart disease rates are higher for men and people with fasting flood sugar above 150 mg/dl and rates tend to increase as age, cholesterol and blood pressure increase. Logistic regressions and AIC were utilized and it was determined that the best model was an additive of cholesterol and sex (AIC = 919.4695), with the second best model being an interactive of cholesterol and age (AIC = 926). From this analysis, it was determined that cholesterol and sex are the two best predictors of whether or not an individual will have heart disease."

However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does heart disease presence and magnitude vary based on the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure? Furthermore, what variables are the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nHeart disease affects hundreds of thousands of people across the world. It can come in many different shapes and forms, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart valve disorders. I hypothesize that the older an individual is, the higher cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure and individual has, the more likely they are to develop a heart disease of large magnitude. I also believe that the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and the number of major vessels are the best predictors of whether or not an individual will develop heart disease. Because the response variable has five levels in factors from 0-4. I plan on combining levels 1-4 into level 1, as that will indicate the presence of heart disease. I also beleive that accuracy is the only metric needed to measure success as there seems to be a roughly even amount of people with and without heart disease, and therefore I do not think that the model will be biased.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

This study relied on self-reported data from patients. Overall there was a minor decrease in the prevalence of CHD in the United States among all demographics. Between 2011 and 2018, the rate dropped from 6.2% to 6.0%. There were plenty of geographic and demographic differences and trends that are worth noting. First, there were some declines in adults over 65, college graduates, and residents of Utah. However, the prevalence of CHD rose in areas like Oregon and in adults 18-44.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe data we have focuses more on the health aspects of heart disease, while the study looks at broad trends in demographics and geography.

The hypothesis for question 1 is that billionaires with higher location gdp are more likely to have founded the company that gave them their wealth, and this holds across age and gender. The hypothesis for question 2 is that billionaires with higher net worth are more likely to be in technology related fields. This relationship changes as age changes because older billionaires are more likely to be in finance since tech was not as big longer ago. The relationship also changes if money was inherited because inherited money more often comes from finance or oil. Age is the best predictor of the sector. \nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical?

How has smoking frequency changed in different regions of the United States over time?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThe research topic is about how smoking frequency has changed over time, particularly by states/regions. The hypothesis for question 1 is that smoking frequently is more common in urban, developed areas and also more common is very rural areas. For this hypothesis, the classifications of urban and rural will be taken from the Bureau of the Census. An urban area is defined as an area with a population of 50,000 or more and a rural area is defined as a place with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants. These areas have already been coded by the Bureau of the Census. The hypothesis for question 2 is that overall smoking frequency has decreased over time due to increased awareness about health risks; additionally, it is hypothesized that there is now a higher percentage of former smokers across the United States. The hypothesis for question 3 is that smoking frequency has decreased in lower population regions but is more constant in higher population regions. Population will be measured by population density criteria from the Bureau of the Census with lower population being defined as 35 people per square mile and higher population defined as 1,600 people per square mile or more.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.
