However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does heart disease presence and magnitude vary based on the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure? Furthermore, what variables are the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nHeart disease affects hundreds of thousands of people across the world. It can come in many different shapes and forms, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart valve disorders. I hypothesize that the older an individual is, the higher cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure and individual has, the more likely they are to develop a heart disease of large magnitude. I also believe that the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and the number of major vessels are the best predictors of whether or not an individual will develop heart disease. Because the response variable has five levels in factors from 0-4. I plan on combining levels 1-4 into level 1, as that will indicate the presence of heart disease. I also beleive that accuracy is the only metric needed to measure success as there seems to be a roughly even amount of people with and without heart disease, and therefore I do not think that the model will be biased.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

This study relied on self-reported data from patients. Overall there was a minor decrease in the prevalence of CHD in the United States among all demographics. Between 2011 and 2018, the rate dropped from 6.2% to 6.0%. There were plenty of geographic and demographic differences and trends that are worth noting. First, there were some declines in adults over 65, college graduates, and residents of Utah. However, the prevalence of CHD rose in areas like Oregon and in adults 18-44.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe data we have focuses more on the health aspects of heart disease, while the study looks at broad trends in demographics and geography.

For this hypothesis, the classifications of urban and rural will be taken from the Bureau of the Census. An urban area is defined as an area with a population of 50,000 or more and a rural area is defined as a place with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants. These areas have already been coded by the Bureau of the Census. The hypothesis for question 2 is that overall smoking frequency has decreased over time due to increased awareness about health risks; additionally, it is hypothesized that there is now a higher percentage of former smokers across the United States. The hypothesis for question 3 is that smoking frequency has decreased in lower population regions but is more constant in higher population regions.
