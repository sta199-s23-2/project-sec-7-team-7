Below 115, lower bp is correlated with higher rates of heart disease. For males, There is not as strong a correlation between blood pressure and heart disease rates. We filtered would bp = 0 because that is not possible and a filler of not recorded data. We chose to facet this by gender because men and women have different average blood pressures.\nStatistical Procedure:\nWe use logistic regressions because we are examining whether or not individuals have heart disease, which is a categorical variable that we must convert to a factor in our data transformation. We filtered out data of cholesterol = 0 and blood pressure = 0 for regressions involving those variables because it is not possible for a living individual and is likely to do data not being collected or a null value, as opposed to the actual value. We chose these variables and interactions because we wanted a large breadth of variables potentially correlating with heart disease. Based on the EDA, we predicted key interactions and then wanted to see how these interactions we predicted to be important, such as bp and sex, cholesterol and age, blood sugar and age, and cholesterol and sex, predicted heart disease. We used AIC to find the best model and chose the two logistic regressions with the lowest AIC values. For the hypothesis test, we wanted to determine if males and females had different rates of heart disease, as suggested in our EDA, so we conducted a two sided hypothesis test. This relates to our research question as we are exploring the factors correlating to heart disease, including sex. We also wanted to determine if those over certain ages, blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure had higher rates of heart disease, as we predicted in our hypothesis, so we conducted a one sided hypothesis test on these topics at cutoffs we determined from our EDA. We used bootstrapping simulation for the hypothesis testing because we were comparing proportions, not means, and CLT is only used for means. Additionally, bootstrapping provides a visualization of the data we used for explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1180.484\n\n\n[1] 1193\n\n\n[1] 988.2217\n\n\n[1] 1135.806\n\n\n[1] 1090.006\n\n\n[1] 926.4628\n\n\n[1] 1071.592\n\n\n[1] 919.4695\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) -2.76      0.429       -6.44 1.17e-10\n2 chol         0.00586   0.00145      4.04 5.30e- 5\n3 sexMale      1.60      0.206        7.77 7.63e-15\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic    p.value\n  <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) -9.54      2.16         -4.42 0.00000992\n2 chol         0.0243    0.00842       2.89 0.00388   \n3 age          0.162     0.0399        4.06 0.0000485 \n4 chol:age    -0.000392  0.000155     -2.52 0.0116    \n\n\nThe best predictor of heart disease rates is an additive model of cholesterol and and sex because it has the lowest AIC of 919.

Furthermore, what variables are the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease? Through a hypothesis test we were able to determine that there is enough statistically significant evidence to conclude that the rate of heart disease in men is not equal to the rate of heart disease in women. Furthermore, though data visualization, we were able to determine that the rate of heart disease in men is greater than that of women.\nWe were also able to determine that age is a significant factor in heart disease and that there was enough statistically significant evidence to conclude that the rate of heart disease in people over 50 is greater than the rate of heart disease in people under 50. We also saw a positive correlation between the cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels and heart disease rates.\nWhile constructing our logistic regression to model whether or not a person will contract heart disease, we found that an additive model of cholesterol and sex would be the best predictors of whether or not a person would contract heart disease.\nOur best model had this equation:\n\\(log(\\hat{p} / (1-\\hat{p})) = -2.76 + .006 * chol + 1.6 * sex\\)\nIn this case, sex would be a 1 if the person was a male, and 0 if the person was a female.\nOverall, we were able to complete our purpose and we found that age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels were all indicators of heart disease, however, sex and cholesterol were the two most accurate predictors.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThere were three key results related to our primary questions that we found significant. First, the rate of heart disease in men is greater than the rate in women. Our visualizations and analysis back this claim. Second, cholesterol and sex were the two best predictors of whether or not an individual may or may not have heart disease. Our models that used the variables of cholesterol and sex had the lowest AIC values. Finally, people who are above the age of 50 were much more likely to have heart disease, and this followed a trend of increased heart disease with age. These findings were supported with our models and our analysis.\nHowever, our data and analysis were limited in some ways, and we acknowledge some changes to make that will make our research stronger. First, our data set is fairly old, as it was made in 1988. This data may not be as up to date as we would like. Perhaps advancement in the field of heart health could yield entirely new data to examine, and the results from our analysis could no longer be applicable to heart disease patients today. Second, while assessing heart disease rates, we only looked at whether heart disease was present and not what the magnitude of the heart disease was. By doing so, we may have missed some key relationships between the predictors and the level of heart disease.\nSignificant Conclusions:\n● The rate of heart disease in men is significantly greater than in women\n● Cholesterol and sex are the two best predictors of whether or not an individual will have heart disease\n● People are significantly more likely to have a heart disease past age 50\nFuture Research:\n● Predict the magnitude of heart disease\n○ Right now it is a binary classification, we want it on a scale from 1-4\n● Transition to specific heart related diseases\n○ Ex: coronary artery disease, heart failure, or heart valve disorders"

    "text": "This research project investigated how heart disease presence and magnitude vary based on age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure as well as which of these variables is the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease. For analysis of the best predictors of heart disease, this project used data collected at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology and Cleveland Clinic Foundation was used. This dataset consisted of 920 observations that each represent a case of heart disease with data for 16 variables, however, this analysis was centered around the variables age, sex, num, trestbps, chol and fbs. Through exploratory data analysis, it was concluded that heart disease rates are higher for men and people with fasting flood sugar above 150 mg/dl and rates tend to increase as age, cholesterol and blood pressure increase. Logistic regressions and AIC were utilized and it was determined that the best model was an additive of cholesterol and sex (AIC = 919.4695), with the second best model being an interactive of cholesterol and age (AIC = 926). From this analysis, it was determined that cholesterol and sex are the two best predictors of whether or not an individual will have heart disease."

However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does heart disease presence and magnitude vary based on the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure? Furthermore, what variables are the best predictor of whether or not an individual will get heart disease?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nHeart disease affects hundreds of thousands of people across the world. It can come in many different shapes and forms, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart valve disorders. I hypothesize that the older an individual is, the higher cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure and individual has, the more likely they are to develop a heart disease of large magnitude. I also believe that the age, sex, cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and the number of major vessels are the best predictors of whether or not an individual will develop heart disease. Because the response variable has five levels in factors from 0-4. I plan on combining levels 1-4 into level 1, as that will indicate the presence of heart disease. I also beleive that accuracy is the only metric needed to measure success as there seems to be a roughly even amount of people with and without heart disease, and therefore I do not think that the model will be biased.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

Between 2011 and 2018, the rate dropped from 6.2% to 6.0%. There were plenty of geographic and demographic differences and trends that are worth noting. First, there were some declines in adults over 65, college graduates, and residents of Utah. However, the prevalence of CHD rose in areas like Oregon and in adults 18-44.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe data we have focuses more on the health aspects of heart disease, while the study looks at broad trends in demographics and geography.

The hypothesis for question 1 is that billionaires with higher location gdp are more likely to have founded the company that gave them their wealth, and this holds across age and gender. The hypothesis for question 2 is that billionaires with higher net worth are more likely to be in technology related fields. This relationship changes as age changes because older billionaires are more likely to be in finance since tech was not as big longer ago. The relationship also changes if money was inherited because inherited money more often comes from finance or oil. Age is the best predictor of the sector. \nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical?

How has smoking frequency changed in different regions of the United States over time?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThe research topic is about how smoking frequency has changed over time, particularly by states/regions. The hypothesis for question 1 is that smoking frequently is more common in urban, developed areas and also more common is very rural areas. For this hypothesis, the classifications of urban and rural will be taken from the Bureau of the Census. An urban area is defined as an area with a population of 50,000 or more and a rural area is defined as a place with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants. These areas have already been coded by the Bureau of the Census. The hypothesis for question 2 is that overall smoking frequency has decreased over time due to increased awareness about health risks; additionally, it is hypothesized that there is now a higher percentage of former smokers across the United States. The hypothesis for question 3 is that smoking frequency has decreased in lower population regions but is more constant in higher population regions. Population will be measured by population density criteria from the Bureau of the Census with lower population being defined as 35 people per square mile and higher population defined as 1,600 people per square mile or more.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.
